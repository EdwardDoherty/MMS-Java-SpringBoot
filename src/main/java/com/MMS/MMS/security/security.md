### Security:
The "Security" folder holds classes related to application security, including configuration for authentication and 
authorization. It may contain components such as security configurations, authentication providers, access control 
rules, and custom security-related classes.

### Notes:
This is one of the last things I'll be working on, so this will likely sit here and do nothing for a long time. But I am
making a financial app where people can store financial data, this needs to be secure.
