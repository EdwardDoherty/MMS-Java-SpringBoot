### Controllers:
The "controllers" folder contains classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, defining RESTful endpoints, 
and processing data. Controllers receive requests, interact with services, and return appropriate responses to the 
client.

### Notes:
So this is the stuff that deals with the connection to the client. Client is sending HTTP requests and the server is 
dealing with those here.
