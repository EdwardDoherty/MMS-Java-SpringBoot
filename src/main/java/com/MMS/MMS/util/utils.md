### Utils: 
The "utils" folder in a Spring Boot application holds utility classes or helper functions providing reusable 
functionality across the application. These classes offer common tasks like data conversion, string manipulation, file 
handling, and more. They promote code organization, reduce duplication, and facilitate accessing and utilizing shared 
functionality.

### Notes:
These are self-explanatory. It'll probably contain a lot of the Date related stuff, and string manipulation.
