### Enums:
The "Enums" folder holds enumerations, which are used to represent a fixed set of constant values in the application. 
Enums provide a convenient way to define and work with predefined options, such as status codes, types, or categories.

### Notes:
This one is fairly self-explanatory as well. Enums go in the Enums folder.
