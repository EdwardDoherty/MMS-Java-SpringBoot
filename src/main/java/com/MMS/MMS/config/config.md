### Config:
The "config" folder holds configuration files for customizing the application's behavior, such as application properties
or YAML files, allowing developers to specify settings like server ports, database connections, and logging
configurations.

### Notes:
This one is pretty self-explanatory. Any random config stuff goes here. DB credentials, API auth stuff, etc. etc.
