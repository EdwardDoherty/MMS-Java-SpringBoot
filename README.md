# Money Management System
### By Edward Doherty

## This is a work in progress. This is a new version of a tool that I built for myself about 2 years ago. This version is intended to be an actual web application that can be used by anyone who makes an account.

NOT your typical budgeting app, I developed this app to solve budgeting issues that I've been unable to find solutions for. This app was inspired by the cash flow issue that arrises when you are paid bi-weekly, but expenses are due on a monthly basis. It includes a number of features that help solve other accounting issues that I have personally run into and been unable to find solutions for. My wife and I both use this software to track our expenses and make financial decisions, and it has been an incredibly useful tool for us.

This is a new version of the app, intended to be an actual web app that can be used by anyone! 
The original version of the app was written in javascript and ran entirely client-side. It also didn't use a database and instead had a long list of class constructors. It was a personal tool, and nothing more. As I developed the software, I realized that this would be a useful tool for a lot of regular people who are in my same situation. So I decided to rebuild it as a "real" full-stack web application with accounts and the rest. 

### Why Java / Spring Boot?
I'm using Java and Spring Boot because I have to use these for a future school project. While doing this, I've realized that I love programming in Java.

### Front End Framework
Originally this was built using Thymeleaf. I chose Thymeleaf as it was required for a school project that I'm going to have to do in the future. I've since decided that I don't particularly like working with Thymeleaf at all, and intend to build an entirely new front-end for this application. I'm not certain which framework I'll be using, but Angular, jte.gg, and React are possible contenders. Right now, I'm not focused on the Front-End side of this project at all, so I may switch to jte (if it ends up being simple enough to do so) and then switching to a more robust front-end (like Angular) later. I currently don't know much Angular or React, and I'm not really ready to take that whole side quest as I still have plenty to do in Java, so jte might be the solution for now. 

### Future plans:
Right now I'm trying to get this to feature parity with the previous (private) version of this software. I'll be releasing the first version of this software when it reaches it's "minimum viable product" stage which is getting close. After feature parity, I will be adding features such as reminders (including a discord bot), paycheck data tracking, more prediction algorithms, debt tracking / payoff / etc, and any other features that my wife and I feel would be useful as we use the software. 

### If you use this software:
Let me know! Let me know what features you'd like.

### If you have constructive criticism:
Let me know what I could do better. I'm still fairly new to Java and back-end web dev in general, so I'd love to hear anything you'd like to add.

### Copyright
I haven't decided what to do with the rights for this project. Please contact me if you want to use this code for anything and let's discuss!
